== UnifiedPush Administration Console User Guide

link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server[AeroGear UnifiedPush] server provides an administration console to ease the process of the registration of your UnifiedPush application with its different 'Variant' types. A 'Push Application' represents an overall mobile application (e.g. Mobile HR), while a 'Variant' is a specific instance of a mobile application targetting a specific platform (e.g. HR Android Free, HR Android Pro, HR iPAD, HR iPhone Free etc.).  Details on the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server are discussed in the server's link:http://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-server-push[documentation]. 

After the server is started, the administration console can be accessed via the following URL: `http://SERVER:PORT/CONTEXT`.

Login
------

When you first access the administration console, you will be presented with the login screen:

[NOTE]
If it is the first time you access the console, you can use the default credentials 'admin:123' to login. For security reasons you will need to change(reset) the password upon first login.

Once you login, you will be presented with the home screen that lists your current configured Push Applications:

Besides the 'Name' and 'Description' of your Push Application, the 'Variants' column display the total number of the different variants configured. From this screen also, you can 'Edit' or 'Remove' a Push Application.

Create a new Push Application
-----------------------------

To create a new Push Application, click the button 'Create' on the upper right corner of the table and the following screen will appear:

Click on the name of your newly created application to reveal its configuration dialog:

In the 'Authentication Info' section, the console displays your Push Application 'ID' and 'Master Secret'. Those id's are used for authentication with the UnifiedPush server when sending notifications. At the bottom of the page the console displays a list of your current configured 'Variants' (initially the list would be empty).

Create a new Variant
--------------------

To create a new 'Variant', click the button 'Create' on the upper right corner of the table and the following screen will appear:

image:./img/console-create-variant.png[Create new Variant Screen]

At the top of the page, you need to fill the 'Name' and 'Description' of your 'Variant' installation. Then, a list of the currently supported Push Networks is displayed for you to choose. Each Push Network requires different number of configurations params, which we will explain below.

[NOTE]
Please make sure correct values are entered on each respective Push Network otherwise the UnifiedPush server won't be able to send Push notifications.

=== Android Variant

To create an Android variant, choose the 'Google Cloud Messaging' option. Then you must fill in the 'API Key' that you obtained from the link:https://code.google.com/apis/console/b/0/?pli=1[Google's API Console]. Please visit our link:http://aerogear.org/docs/guides/aerogear-push-android/google-setup/[Google Setup section] in our link:http://aerogear.org/docs/guides/aerogear-push-android/[Android Push Notification guide] for more information.

=== iOS Variant

To create an iOS variant, choose the 'Apple Push Network' option. You need to upload your Push Notification Client SSL certificate obtained from link:https://developer.apple.com/account/overview.action[Apple's Provisioning Portal], as well as provide the required 'Passphrase' that you entered when you exported the certificate. If it is a Production SSL certificate, check the 'Production' checkbox in order for the UnifiedPush server to contact the appropriate Apple servers when sending the notification. Please visit our link:http://aerogear.org/docs/guides/aerogear-push-ios/app-id-ssl-certificate-apns/[Apple Setup section] in our link:http://aerogear.org/docs/guides/aerogear-push-ios/[iOS Push Notification guide] for more information.

=== SimplePush Variant

To create a SimplePush variant, choose the 'SimplePush' option. No configuration parameters are required for this Push Network type. For more information on SimplePush please visit our link:http://aerogear.org/docs/guides/aerogear-push-js/[SimplePush Push Notification guide].

List of Variants
----------------

You can see the currently configured variants in the Push Application's overview screen. The 'Platform' of each 'Variant' is displayed, as well as the total number of current active mobile 'Instances'. An instance represents an actual device (or a web application client for 'SimplePush') registered in the UnifiedPush server.

Clicking on the 'Name' of a variant will reveal its configuration dialog.

Variant Details Screen
----------------------

In this screen the console displays a list of all the current active installations, as well as the Variant's 'ID' and 'Secret', used by your client SDK to register your installation with the UnifiedPush Server. For each installation, useful metadata are displayed such as the device token, device type and platform. Further, the 'Status' column indicates whether the installation is able to receive notifications. You can toggle this status, as we will see in the next section in the Installation details screen.

Clicking on the 'Token' column will reveal the 'Installation Details' screen for more details of that particular installation.

Installation Details Screen
---------------------------

In this screen the console displays full details of a particular installation and gives an option to toggle the ability for a device to receive notifications. The 'Alias' and 'Category' columns display the values used by the developer during registration of the installation and are useful when performing 'selected send' against the UnifiedPush server. You can consult this screen to verify why a particular device is not receiving the notification (e.g. by incorrect values entered by the developer).

Logout
------

To logout from the administration console, simply click the 'Logout' link in the upper right corner and will bring you back to the login screen.


Conclusion
----------

The UnifiedPush administration console is in its early stages of development, but already provides enough support for a user during the initial setup of his application in the UnifiedPush server. As the development of the UnifiedPush server progresses and new features been added, the console will be enhanced to support them.
