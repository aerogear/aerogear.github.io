The UnifiedPush Server
-----------------------


With all the Apple work being done, we are now ready to setup the link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server[UnifiedPush Server], so that it can be used to connect to APNs for a later message sending.

AeroGear UnifiedPush Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_ defines logical _abstraction_ for Mobile Applications that have support for different Push Networks. It's _Push Applications_ can have different "Variants". For this tutorial we need to create a _Push Application_ which will contain two _Variants_ (one for iOS _Development_ and one for iOS _Production_ app). Details on the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server are discussed link:http://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/ups_userguide/overview/[here].

For the purpose of the guide, we will be using the AdminUI console and assume that you have already link:http://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/ups_userguide/server-installation/[installed] and link:http://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/ups_userguide/admin-ui/[logged in] in the UnifiedPush Administration console.

=== Register a Push Application 

Now that we are logged in, let's create a new _Push Application_.

In the Navigation panel, the Applications icon brings you to the management section for PushApplications:

Now click the Create Application button which brings up a dialog to provide a name and an optional description:

Now that we have our new application, you will notice that we have no variants. Time to create one. Click on the "No variants" icon to get started

=== Register an iOS Variant

Time to register our iOS Variant. Click on the _Add Variant_ button

Fill in a _name_ and a _description_ and choose the iOS option from the list of available variant types. Doing so, will reveal a new dialog to upload the SSL Certificate we created earlier, as well as the the options to enter the _Passphrase_  and the choice between _Production_ and _Development_ variant.

Once finish editing, click the _Add_ button and the variant will be created on server.

Notice an _Example Installation_ link which, when clicked, reveals a screen with source code examples for the registration to the UPS, with the settings preconfigured automatically based on the current environment. A handy feature that you can refer when creating your own applications to easy the setup process.

NOTE: Clicking on the appropriate tab, you can choose between _Objective-C_, _Swift_ and _Cordova_ snippet!


Xcode
~~~~~

The server is now configured. Let's move to Xcode to create a very simple link:../iOS-app[example application] that will connect to the UnifiedPush server and start receiving notifications.
