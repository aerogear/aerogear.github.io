Using the Admin UI
------------------

The UnifiedPush Server can be accessed via its RESTful endpoints, as well over an administrative user interface. Once you have the UnifiedPush Server running, whether on link:../openshift[Openshift] or link:../server-installation[standalone], it is time to open the _AdminUI_, by accessing +http(s)://SERVER:PORT/ag-push+ in your browser. You are prompted by a login dialog:

The default credentials are +admin+/+123+. On the very first login you are asked to update the password. It is a wise idea to change it to something completely different:

After applying the new password you are able to use the AdminUI of the UnifiedPush Server:
