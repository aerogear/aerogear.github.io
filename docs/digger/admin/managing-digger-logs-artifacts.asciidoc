== Managing Digger Build Logs and Artifacts
App builds started by Digger produce build logs and build artifacts.
Over time, these will build up. There are a number of options to manage the buildup. If you are using Digger with RHMAP, these options can be specified
by setting environment variables in the `millicore` deployment(???) configuration in
RHMAP. Configuration options found in Jenkins along with associated RHMAP properties are detailed below.

NOTE: Entire Jenkins configuration regarding Digger artifacts can be performed using the
GUI in  `<Job Name> -> Configure -> Discard Old Builds` with the
`Log Rotation` strategy enabled.

|===
| Option | Configure in Jenkins | RHMAP property

| Days to keep builds
