== Installing Jenkins plugins
Digger will by default install a number of Jenkins plugins required for its proper operation. If more Jenkins plugins are required, they can be specified in Ansible playbook(???) or using the Jenkins user interface.

NOTE: Plugins for Jenkins can be found at link::https://plugins.jenkins.io. (PLEASE VERIFY LINK SYNTAX)

=== Using Ansible Playbook
The `jenkins_plugins` parameter can be overridden to include new plugins. The
structure of a Jenkins plugin is as follows.

[source,yaml]
----
-
  name: sample-plugin
  version: 1.20
  archive: http://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/plugins/sample-plugin/1.20/sample-plugin.hpi
----

=== Using Jenkins UI
Go to `Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins`. If the plugin is not available in the
`Available` tab then it can be installed by uploading an `.hpi` file in
`Advanced -> Upload Plugin`.
