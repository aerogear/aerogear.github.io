== Overview

The AeroGear Digger project leverages Jenkinsfiles to build applications.
A Jenkinsfile will need to exist in a repo for it to be built succesfully.

This guide covers the basic anatomy of a Jenkinsfile, plugins that can
be used to help with building and signing applications and migrating an
existing application to using a Jenkinsfile.

Further information on using Jenkinsfiles is available in the
