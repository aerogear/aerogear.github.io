==== macOS and macOS Ansible Scripts Configuration

- Grant the Installer `sudo` priviledges by entering the password into the `ansible_sudo_pass` variable.
//?????? IN THE ANSIBLE INVENTORY FILE OR WHERE
//???? sudo or root? or is it the same in this context?

.macOS Scripts: https://github.com/aerogear/digger-jenkins/blob/master/admin/create-osx-user.sh[create-osx-user.sh] https://github.com/aerogear/digger-jenkins/blob/master/admin/enable-osx-remote-login.sh[enable-osx-remote-login.sh]
- Set up a user with sudo permissions and SSH access.
These scripts will create a user named `jenkins` with SSH access.
It is highly recommended to set a strong `PASSWORD` in `create-osx-user.sh`.

//how???

The macOS requires a network access to the following hosts:

.Hosts and resources they provide:
|===
| Hostname | Provides

| https://github.com
| `Homebrew packages` and `Cocoapods`

| `NVM - Node Version Manager`

| https://rvm.io
| `RVM - Ruby Version Manager`
