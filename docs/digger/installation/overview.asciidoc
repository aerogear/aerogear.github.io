== Overview

The AeroGear Digger project allows developers to quickly setup a service that can be used to build mobile applications on OpenShift.

It is consisted of the following main components:

* A Jenkins server that is used to run all the build tasks
* A Docker-formated image with all the required tools to build Android applications
* Mac servers with pre-installed tools to build iOS applications
* An http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/index.html[Ansible] based automation tool to install and configure all the other components
* A suite of sample Jenkinsfile to show case how to build mobile applications using Jenkins pipeline

At the moment, the main objective of the project is to be used with the RedHat Application Platform (RHMAP).
However, it should be possible to use it on its own as a CI/CD server for mobile applications.
