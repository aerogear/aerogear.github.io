=== Using HTTP/HTTPS Proxy with Aerogear Digger (optional)

WARNING: HTTP Proxies that require authentication are not supported.
Please read the <<Known Issues>> for more details.

You can install AeroGear Digger behind a proxy by modifying variables in the Ansible playbook.

The installer will automatically configure the following components to use a proxy (if the component requires outbound Internet access):

* The Jenkins server
* The Android SDK pod used to download Android SDKs
* Container/node that will run the build jobs, by adding the environment variables such as `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` in the inventory file. 
* macOS tools for iOS builds. See <<macos-prereqs>>.

Set these variables in an Inventory file, or with the CLI.
