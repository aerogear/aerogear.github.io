== Known issues

=== Issues with using HTTP Proxy

==== HTTP proxy with mac Jenkins node
When adding a mac machine as a node/slave in Jenkins a direct connection is
required, meaning a HTTP proxy is not supported.

==== HTTP proxy authentication in Android builds
When building Android apps, the pod in which the apps are built cannot use a
proxy that requires authentication. This is due to a issue within Gradle.

==== Android SDK Manager tools don't support HTTP proxy with authentication
When installing the Android SDK into the SDK pod during provisioning, the
Android sdkmanager tools used doesn't support http proxy that requires
authentication.

=== Issues with Ansible provisioning

==== Encrypted private key cannot be provided in Ansible provisioning
The user's private key can not be encrypted when running the Ansible playbook.

Note that this does not include the key pair that should be provided when
provisioning the macOS node, the private key of the macOS key pair should be
encrypted with a passphrase.

To work around this you can use `openssl` to remove the passphrase from your key using the
following command.

----
openssl rsa -in ~/.ssh/id_rsa -out ~/.ssh/id_rsa_new

=== iOS Build Limitations

==== No Build Isolation Support

At the moment, the iOS builds do not support isolation. This means if one iOS build process changes the settings/environment, it will impact on the next iOS build.

==== No Parallel Builds Support On A Single Mac Server

Due to each iOS build needs to update some of the global configurations (like certifications, keys etc), only 1 iOS build is allowed at a time on a single Mac server.
If you need to support parallel iOS builds, you will need to configure multiple Mac servers.
