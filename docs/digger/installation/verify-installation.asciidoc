== System Health Monitoring

To monitor the status of the Digger service, the Digger installer will also install https://www.nagios.org/[Nagios] and several Nagios checks that monitor:

* Status of the Jenkins container (pod),
* Status of the network link between Jenkins and the macOS servers,
* Load statistics of the macOS servers.

The installer will automatically check the Nagios status at the end of the installation.
You can also login to the Nagios dashboard and check the status manually.
