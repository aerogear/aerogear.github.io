== Verify Installation

To help verify and monitor the status of the Digger service, the Digger installer will also install https://www.nagios.org/[Nagios] and some checks to monitor:

* The status of the Jenkins container (pod)
* The connectivity between Jenkins and the Mac servers (if any)
* The load stats of the Mac servers (if any)

The installer will automatically check the Nagios status at the end of the run.
You can also manually login to the Nagios dashboard and check the status.
