== Run the Digger Installer

.To run the Digger installer, follow these steps:

. Clone the https://github.com/aerogear/digger-installer[Digger Installer GitHub repo]

. Make a copy of the `inventory-sample` file from the repo, and update it to provide the information about your cluster.
For more details about the macOS Server configurations, please check the <<Setup macOS Servers>> section.

. To build Android applications, you may need to <<Configure the Android SDK components>>.
//TODO: remove this step once we can configure Android SDK components via Ansible variables.
. Run the following command and follow the instructions printed in the terminal:
----
ansible-playbook -i your-inventory-copy sample-build-playbook.yml
----

.The sample Ansible playbook will perform the following tasks:

* Create a project in OpenShift
* Install Jenkins (tag: `deploy-jenkins`)
* Install Android SDK to a Persistent Volume (tag: `android-sdk`)
* Configure Jenkins (tag: `configure-buildfarm`)
* Setup macOS Servers (tag: `provision-osx`)

NOTE: All the tasks in the installer are idempotent and you can run them multiple times and they will produce the same results.

More details about these tasks are explained in the following sections. If you are not interested in the details, skip to <<Verify Installation>>.


=== Running Installer steps individually
If you want to run specific tasks, you can pass the task tag values to the following command.
For example, to only run the "install Jenkins" task, run:

.Passing single and multiple tags to Ansible
----
ansible-playbook -i your-inventory-copy sample-build-playbook.yml --tags="deploy-jenkins"
----
----
ansible-playbook -i your-inventory-copy sample-build-playbook.yml --tags="deploy-jenkins","android-sdk","configure-buildfarm"
----
