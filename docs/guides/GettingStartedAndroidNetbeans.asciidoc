== Get Started on With AeroGear Android on NetBeans


This guide will walk you through configuring your build environment to support AeroGear on Android as well as importing the project into NetBeans.  If you have already completed the link:../GetStartedAndroid/[command line getting started guide] then you can just open your project in NetBeans.  

After the library has been built, we will clone and run the https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-android-todo[TODO sample application] to confirm it is working.

=== Requirements
* Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6)+
** link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[The latest Java version can be found on Oracle's site]
* Maven 3+
** link:http://maven.apache.org/download.html[The latest Maven version can be found on Apaches's site]
* Git
** link:http://git-scm.com/downloads[The latest Git version can be found at http://git-scm.com]
* Android SDK
** Need to have an AVD image running 4.1 (API level 16)
** link:http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html[The latest Android SDK and instructions to install]
* NetBeans 7.2+


=== Setup Library
==== Setup Maven Android SDK Deployer

We need to have the https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer[Android Maven SDK Deployer] installed and configured.  These are only quickstart instructions, the Android Maven SDK Deployer GitHub has a much more in depth install guide.

You must have the version of the platform installed through the Android SDK as you are using for your profile.  In this example, make sure Android 4.1 is installed.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer.git
cd maven-android-sdk-deployer
export ANDROID_HOME=YOUR_ANDROID_SDK_DIRECTORY
mvn install -P 4.1
----

Now Maven will be able to include Android 4.1 as a dependency.  There are also profiles for other version of Android.

==== Downloading and Opening the Project

* From the "Team" menu select "Git" and then "Clone"

==== Building the Project

* Right click on the Project and select "Clean and Build"


image:img/GettingStartedNetBeans/clean_and_build_thumbnail.png["Selecting Clean and Build from Context Menu",width=250,link="../img/GettingStartedNetBeans/clean_and_build.png"]

* This will fire off the Maven Build.  You should see "BUILD SUCCESS" if everything went right.

=== Setup Sample TODO Project
==== Downloading and Opening the Project

* Follow the same steps as you did to download the library, but use "https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-android-todo.git" As your "Repository URL"

==== Running
* You should update your settings.xml file to include information about the AVD image you wish to use.  In this example we are loading an image named "JB", but you can use any AVD (running Android of at least version 2.3) you wish.
.settings.xml
[source,xml]
-----
<settings>
    <activeProfiles>
        <activeProfile>local</activeProfile>
    </activeProfiles>
    <profiles>
        <profile>
            <id>local</id>
            <properties>
                <android.avd>JB</android.avd>
                <android.device>JB</android.device>
            </properties>
        </profile>
    </profiles>
</settings>
-----

* Your AVD Name can be found in the AVD Manager

image:img/GettingStartedNetBeans/edit_debug_thumbnail.png["Edit the Debug Action",width=250,link="../img/GettingStartedNetBeans/edit_debug.png"]

** Set "Execute Goals" to "android:deploy android:run"
** Add to "Set Properties" the following:
[source]
----
undeployBeforeDeploy=true
runDebug=true
debug=true
----

** Start Android Monitor
    $ANDROID_HOME/tools/monitor
** Launch the application in debug mode from NetBeans
** Note the port shown in the monitor


image:img/GettingStartedNetBeans/debug_port_thumbnail.png["AVD Monitor Showing TODO App Port",width=250,link="../img/GettingStartedNetBeans/debug_port.png"]

** In NetBeans from "Debug" select "Attach Debugger" and enter into port the port number from the monitor.


image:img/GettingStartedNetBeans/attach_debug_thumbnail.png["The Attach to Debugger window",width=250,link="../img/GettingStartedNetBeans/attach_debug.png"]

** Your application should now be running in debug mode and breakpoints in NetBeans should work
