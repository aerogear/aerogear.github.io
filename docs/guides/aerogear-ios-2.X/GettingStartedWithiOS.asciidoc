== Get Started with iOS platform

If you're brand new to iOS, this first section will give you interesting links to start with iOS environment and platform. We've all been a beginner at one point, do not fear iOS platform is easy to start with specially with its new Swift language.

== Prerequisites
- Get a mac and an iOS device. 
- Target the latest release: install Yosemite, Xcode 6.1.1. iOS 8.1.3

== Online Training
If you like screencast and MOOC session, I'd recommend the excellent Stanford classes. You can find them for free on link:https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-8-apps-swift/id961180099[iTunes].

== Books
There are plenty of good books to learn from, among good one here is a book with tutorials from link:http://www.raywenderlich.com/store/ios-apprentice[Ray Wenderlich].

To start with Swift, we recommend the link:https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/GuidedTour.html[Swift guided tour]. 

== Get started with AeroGear

=== AeroGear: Xcode and iOS

==== AeroGear 2.X
Our libraries for AeroGear iOS 2.X are Swift based you will need at least Xcode 6.1.1.

Runtime for Swift based demo and libraries is 8.X.

==== AeroGear 1.6.X
Our earlier version work for Xcode 5 and iOS 6. 

**Note** Although still supported AeroGear 1.6.X is a deprecated branch, all new features go in 2.X version (on master for all libraries).

=== Build with cocoapods

Our Swift and ObjC libraries are build using link:http://cocoapods.org/[Cocoapods 0.36.0].
In your Podfile add the AeroGear dependencies you're interested in (here for example OAuth2):

```bash
pod 'AeroGearOAuth2'
```
**Note:** For Swift dependencies we use "dependencies as framework". 
You need to add ```use_frameworks!``` to your Podfile.
Read more about it link:http://blog.cocoapods.org/Pod-Authors-Guide-to-CocoaPods-Frameworks/[here] and see for example our link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-cookbook/blob/master/Jedi/JsonPatchSync/Podfile#L5[cookbook podfile].

and then run:

```
pod install
```

to install your dependencies. Open the xcodeworkspace to work with it.

== Going further with AeroGear

Once you get familiar with the environment, you are ready to try out our link:/getstarted/demos/#ios[cookbook recipes] or carry on with link:/ios/[AeroGear iOS overview page].
