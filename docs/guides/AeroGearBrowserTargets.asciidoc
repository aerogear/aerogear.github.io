Notes
-----

HTML5 support varies by browser, however the browsers listed above should support all basic behaviors and functionality.  Some examples of acceptable differences are below.

* Browser support for field validation
** Chrome has the best support, other browsers have different levels of support
** No matter the browser support, the applications should still produce an invalid message, but it will be server based, not browser. 

* Input keyboard customization
** iOS browsers support custom keyboards for email, phone numbers, etc...
** Android browsers only support phone number custom keyboard
** No matter the support input should be possible
