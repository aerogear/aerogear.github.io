=== Downloading and Importing AeroGear

AeroGear is a Maven based build project.  With the exception of one set up set, we eschew Maven for a more traditional Android + Eclipse experience.  As such we will not be using or need a2e and a2e-android.

==== Getting the source with git
When you clone your sources, be sure to NOT download them into your Eclipse workspace directory.

[source,bash]
----
 git clone https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-android.git
 cd aerogear-android/
 mvn dependency:copy; #This will download all of the required dependancies and place them in /libs
----

==== Importing the project into Eclipse

* Right click in project panel 

* Select Import
