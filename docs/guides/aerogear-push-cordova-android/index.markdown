## Apache Cordova and GCMs Push Notifications with AeroGear's UnifiedPush Server

The following step-by-step guides, give you an introduction on how to use the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server for sending Push Notifications to your own Cordova-android Apps.

### Google Setup

First you'll need to setup the Google Cloud Messaging Service API access. The steps are the same as those that are required for native android. The [GCM Push Notifications with AeroGearâ€™s UnifiedPush Server](/docs/guides/aerogear-push-android/) explains them:

* [Setup Google Cloud Messaging Service](/docs/guides/aerogear-push-android/google-setup/)

### AeroGear UnifiedPush Server
