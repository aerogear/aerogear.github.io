Configure the Build
-------------------

There are a few preparatory steps you must take to be able to get an application up and running. For this example, we will be using ``pusheedemoapp''.

Getting the Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clone the git repo of https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-android[aerogear-android] and switch to the ``push'' branch
[source,c]
----
git clone https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-android.git
git checkout push
----

Clone the git repo of https://github.com/secondsun/PushEEDemo.git[pusheedemo]
[source,c]
----
git clone https://github.com/secondsun/PushEEDemo
----

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since aerogear utilizes Maven, many of the below steps can be skipped by running
[source,c]
----
mvn dependency:copy
----
This will install the dependencies into the /libs folder of the project, so ADT will pick them up automatically.

If you choose not to build with Maven, then you will need to configure the projects in Eclipse. Right click ``aerogear-android'', choose ``Properties'', then choose ``Android'', and check ``Is Library''.
Now, right click PushEEDemo, and choose ``Properties'' again. Click ``Android'', and Add aerogear-android to the Library section. This will include the necessary resources needed for AeroGear. In addition, make sure that 
your build target is >= 4.0, due to the fragments API Google introduced.

Finally, we also need to add a few Android and Google resources to the build path. In the ``Java Build Path'' of PushEEDemo, 
choose ``Libraries'', and ``Add External JARs...'' We need to import android-support-v*.jar, where * denotes a version number.

*This JAR is located in $ANDROID_HOME/extras/android/support. If you do not have this in your SDK, use the SDK Manager to 
download it. Located under ``Extras'', install ``Android Support Library''.*

Depending upon your configuration, you may need to also reference the following external JARs (followed by location) in your *aerogear-android* project:

- Android Support Libraries: android-support-v*.jar ($ANDROID_HOME/extras/android/support/v*)
- Google Guava: https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/[guava.jar]
- Google GSon: https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/[gson-v-v-v.jar] (v is version)
- Google Play Services: google-play-services.jar ($ANDROID_HOME/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/google-play-services_lib/libs/)
