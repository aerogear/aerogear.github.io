== Note
If you only want to build Android applications using AeroGear you do not need to build the project from source.  Our compiled ready to go binaries are available in Maven Central.  If you want to contribute to AeroGear Android then read on.

== Building
AeroGear's Android libraries are built as aar projects using Maven, but Google does not ship all the required libraries to Maven Central. You must locally deploy them using the link:https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer[maven-android-sdk-deployer].

=== Checkout maven-android-sdk-deployer
```
git clone git://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer.git
```

=== Install Android platform
```
cd $PWD/maven-android-sdk-deployer/platforms/android-24
mvn install -N --quiet
```

=== Install locally Android and Google libraries 
```
cd $PWD/maven-android-sdk-deployer/repositories
mvn install --quiet
```
