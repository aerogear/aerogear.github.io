Deploying HTML5 Applications to Openshift
-----------------------------------------
This guide will show you how to deploy HTML5+REST based applications to Openshift using JBoss Tools.  It also contains links and information for using Openshift's command line tools.

Prerequisites
-------------
This article assumes you have created an application following the instructions in link:../GetStartedHTML5MobileWeb[Get Started With HTML5 Mobile Web Development].  In that guide you created a new HTML5+REST based mobile web application using JBoss Tools, and have it deploying and executing locally.

Openshift Setup
---------------
Before you get started you need to create a free OpenShift account, it only takes about 5-10 minutes.  Just follow their link:https://openshift.redhat.com/app/getting_started[Get Started Guide].  You can then either setup you domain online, or using the JBoss Tools as described in the section below.

Using JBoss Tools
-----------------
One of the new features of JBoss Tools is the JBoss Central page seen below.  This should launch by default when the IDE starts.

Instead of just duplicated all of the great work done by JBoss Tools you can follow the instructions in this guide link:https://community.jboss.org/en/tools/blog/2012/06/27/deploy-from-eclipse-to-openshift-in-a-breeze[Deploy from eclipse to Openshift is a breeze].  Just select the application you built when the instructions talk about link:https://community.jboss.org/en/tools/blog/2012/06/27/deploy-from-eclipse-to-openshift-in-a-breeze#JBoss_Tools_configure_my_project[using an existing project].
  
There is also a short video that shows the exact steps to get our HTML5 mobile web project built, and deployed to Openshift.

Using Command Line Tools
------------------------
OpenShift also comes with a set of command line tools to make scripting and working with your account from the command line easier.  You can find all of the information needed for these in the link:https://openshift.redhat.com/app/getting_started[installation and user guide] for OpenShift.
