== HTML5 + REST Applications

What is a HTML5 + REST application? This could just as easily be called a "plain old open web" application. The HTML5 revolution causes developers to think differently about their overall architecture, with more JavaScript and CSS on the client-side and RESTful endpoints on the server-side. But, the web hasn't changed it's just gotten better and "more open" - this is a direct result of HTML5, the community (you), and moving the web forward.

A picture is worth a thousand words, so let's have a look:

As you can see, we have all the goodness which exists under the HTML5 unmbrella on the left side. Our focus for the client side tier of a HTML5 application is:

* Security
* Offline Storage
* Performance
* Connectivity
* Device Access

We are leveraging the latest and greatest web technologies on mobile, desktop, and device browsers to bring developers a unified and structured enterprise development workflow.

For our latest example of a HTML5 application you can get started with the link:../GetStartedHTML5MobileWeb[how-to article] which guides you step by step, or https://github.com/jboss-jdf/jboss-as-quickstart/tree/master/kitchensink-html5-mobile[fork it on github].

With advanced client side development, we must provide solid backend services with a public or private infrastructure. In the diagram and with all our hosted demos within the AeroGear project, you will find https://openshift.redhat.com[OpenShift] as the deployment platform. In just a few minutes, you can have load balanced, on-demand images of the latest JBoss Application server supporting Java EE6 and all the cool (and reliable) technologies that come along with it (CDI, REST, Messaging, Data Grids, etc...).
