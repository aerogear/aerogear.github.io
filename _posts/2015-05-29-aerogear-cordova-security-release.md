Today we would like to announce the critical security release for all Android developers using our AeroGear Cordova plugins and we strongly encourage you to update your apps immediately.

The Android plugins from Cordova were affected by [CVE-2015-1835](https://cordova.apache.org/announcements/2015/05/26/android-402.html) â€” announced earlier this week. As an added precaution, however, we have patched all the projects to ensure that our developers cannot be exploited.
