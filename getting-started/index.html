  <p>AeroGear provides a suite of Mobile Services across a range of client SDKs that will simplify your mobile and modern application development needs, leveraging OpenShift's Container technology to provide a secure, scalable backend platform.</p>

Each Service has a corresponding SDK module which is imported into your mobile app. These SDK modules provide connectivity to your back end services on OpenShift and perform the "heavy lifting" - allowing developers to focus on the business value of their mobile apps.</p>
